# Malicious-URL-Detection
The Malicious URL Detection project uses machine learning to classify URLs into categories like Phishing, Malware, Defacement, or Benign. It employs feature engineering and models such as Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, trained on a labeled dataset to identify and assess potential URL threats.
